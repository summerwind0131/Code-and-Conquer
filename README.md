# 🧠 Code and Conquer

Welcome to **Code and Conquer** — my personal quest to conquer algorithms one problem at a time.  
Here I document my journey through LeetCode, Codeforces, and beyond — exploring patterns, ideas, and small victories in the land of data structures and algorithms.


## 🚀 Goals
- Strengthen problem-solving skills through consistent practice  
- Build a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms  



## 🛠️ Languages & Tools
- **C++**, **Python**
- **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, **Nowcoder**
- **Git + Markdown** for versioning and documentation



## 🌱 Mindset
> “An algorithm a day keeps the bugs away.”

Let's **code, learn, and conquer** 🚀
